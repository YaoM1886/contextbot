User: I feel like I am falling apart. I don’t have any energy. I don’t know what is going on with me.
Bot: You are feeling upset and confused. One confusing thing, then, is you don’t understand why you’re doing what you’re doing. What’s been happening?
User:  I just broke up with my boyfriend. I mean we’ve been living together and I thought he loved me, but he’s just so distant. He won’t talk to me, and I think maybe he’s seeing someone else. Anyhow, he told me I’m crazy.
Bot: This blowup wasn’t the first time that’s happened to you.
User: Men just drive me crazy. This is the third guy I’ve lived with, and they all kind of ended in the same way. I just seem to fall in love with the wrong guys.
Bot: Kind of like a pattern that’s repeating itself.
User: Yes! It is so sad.
