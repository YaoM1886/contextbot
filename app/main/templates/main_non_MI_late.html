What\u2019s been happening?", "This blowup wasn\u2019t the first time that\u2019s happened to you.", "Kind of like a pattern that\u2019s repeating itself.", "These are really strong feelings. It\u2019s pretty painful that this has happened once again.", "That frightens you, not understanding what is going on with you.", "And that annoyed you.", "All right. What you\u2019ve told me so far is that these really strong feelings, and how you\u2019ve reacted, are scaring you a little. You\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re having trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. You really blew up at Ray and felt out of control, and you\u2019re also wondering about what seems like a painful pattern that repeats itself in your relationships with men. You don\u2019t have much energy, feel lonely, and sometimes you just break out crying for no apparent reason. But you especially wonder what\u2019s happening.", "Yes, I do. This all feels pretty strange to you, even coming here, but I\u2019ve worked with women before who have had concerns like this, and I believe I can help. If our work together were really successful from your perspective, what would be different?", "So one thing you\u2019d like to change is how you\u2019re feeling. Tell me a little more about that.", "OK, you\u2019d like to get your emotional life settled down some, to be able to sleep better and have more energy. What else?", "That\u2019s another thing that upsets you\u2014not knowing why you feel so bad and why these things happen to you.", "I do have an idea that puts some of the pieces of the puzzle together. If it\u2019s alright with you, we can talk about that next.", "You\u2019re really struggling to understand what is happening to you, and I wonder if I might ask you what you already knew about depression.", "Well, if it\u2019s all right, let me describe some of what people experience with depression, and you can tell me what parts of this may fit for you.", "Depression is really a set of different symptoms, and you don\u2019t need to have all of them. It\u2019s like when people catch a cold; they experience it in different ways. Depression is like that\u2014a set of symptoms that might or might not be present. Does that make sense?", "One of them, as you said, is in a sad mood, feeling down, crying.", "Another change is in sleeping patterns. Some people have trouble sleeping. Some lose their weight. Have you experienced any of those?", "OK. As I said, different people have different symptoms. It sounds like you have quite a few of them. Have I been clear? What else can I tell you about depression?", "The next thing is how you would like things to be different. You know how you don\u2019t want to feel. How do you want to feel?", "You\u2019d like to feel happy and good about yourself again. What else?", " How important is that to you, to have a relationship like that?", "You need that.", "Tell me a little about why you want to feel better.", "It would be good to feel lighthearted, to enjoy life and be with your friends.", "Well I was just going to ask you about that. What are some of your personal strengths? What might your friends say that you have going for you?", "Give me an example. When have you done something or made a change in your life that really took some effort, maybe something you weren\u2019t sure at first that you could do?", " It takes a lot to move to a new place on your own. How did you do it?", " And you did it. That\u2019s a lot of change to manage.", "So use your imagination here. Suppose that we work together and you are successful in making these changes. How might your life be different, say, 5 years from now?", "Well, thanks for all you\u2019ve told me. You\u2019ve been feeling a lot of turmoil in your life and I appreciate how honest and open you have been with me. Let me just pull together what you\u2019ve told me, and then we\u2019ll see what the next step is. You would really like to start feeling better, you\u2019ve been feeling really bad, like you have been dragging a great weight around with you, and you\u2019re rather tired of feeling like your friends avoid you. In the longer run you also want to have an open, warm, and loving relationship with a man. You\u2019re a pretty resourceful person. You moved here from Ireland all on your own and set up a new life for yourself. You\u2019re also a stubborn and persistent person. Once you make up your mind to do something it\u2019s likely to happen. You would like to understand what\u2019s been going wrong in your relationships because somewhere down the line you would like to be married, and you also mentioned finding a better job as a longer-term goal. You\u2019ve been through a lot of emotional pain, and you\u2019re eager for a calmer and happier life. First of all, I would like to know what ideas you have for how you might start feeling better. No one knows you better than you do, and I\u2019m sure you have tried some things in the past to lift your mood a bit. Tell me about those.", "A pleasant movie is one thing that can lift your spirits sometimes. What else?", "You know that about yourself\u2014getting out helps. And what do you do when you leave your apartment?"];

I mean we\u2019ve been living together and I thought he loved me, but he\u2019s just so distant. He won\u2019t talk to me, and I think maybe he\u2019s seeing someone else. Anyhow, he told me I\u2019m crazy.", "Men just drive me crazy. This is the third guy I\u2019ve lived with, and they all kind of ended in the same way. I just seem to fall in love with the wrong guys.", "Yes! It is so sad.", "I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t think. I\u2019m a mess at work. I was waiting on a customer this week and just started crying for no reason. I think I\u2019m losing it.", "It\u2019s just so discouraging! I was so happy with Ray when we were first together. There\u2019s this soft teddy bear inside his tough exterior, and that\u2019s the man I loved, but then he wouldn\u2019t open up to me anymore.", "Yes! It\u2019s such a waste for him to stay locked up inside there, and I was lonely even though we were living together. Anyhow, he\u2019s gone now. He moved out. It\u2019s over.", "Yes. Do you think you can help me?", "I guess I wouldn\u2019t feel so bad all the time.", "I just feel upset and I\u2019m crying a lot. I\u2019m not sleeping and I feel worn out, run down.", "Yes. I also want to know why I keep screwing up all my relationships. What\u2019s wrong with me?", "Yes, can you help me figure these out?", "Sure. What is your idea?", "I guess it\u2019s like when you feel really sad and down, maybe don\u2019t have energy to do anything. Do you think that\u2019s what I have?", "Yes, OK.", "Yes, what are the symptoms?", "That sounds like me. I\u2019m not having much fun lately.", "I\u2019m certainly not sleeping well. But my weight did not change.", "That sounds alright.", "Normal, I guess. Happy. To have energy to do things again. When I broke up with Ray it just made me crazy. I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me, that I always screw up my relationships.", "I want to be with a man who loves me. I seem to attract guys who are hung up about telling me how they feel. I need a man I can talk to.", "Very important. I don\u2019t want to be alone. I need to be loved.", "Yes! I don\u2019t want to keep destroying relationships. I don\u2019t know why I do that.", "I just feel like I\u2019m dragging around this heavy weight with me all the time. I like to have fun, but I\u2019ve really become a drag to be with. I feel like even my friends avoid me.", "Yes it would. Do you think it\u2019s possible for me?", "I don\u2019t know. They\u2019d probably say that I\u2019m stubborn. I\u2019ve been pretty persistent in the past.", "Moving here. I had always lived in Ireland near my father and my sisters, and I moved out here all by myself. I just wanted to be on my own for a change, to get away. But now I feel too much on my own.", "I had to find a job here, and I started going to classes at the university. I had to get used to a different culture, figure out the stores and banking system, and make some friends.", "I never thought much about it. I guess I can do it when it\u2019s important enough.", "I\u2019d be married, maybe have a family. I\u2019d have a better job that I enjoy more. I just wouldn\u2019t be stressing out like this all the time. A calmer life.", "Sometimes I have gone to a funny, romantic movie and it makes me smile, but it also reminds me of what I don\u2019t have in a relationship.", "Getting out of my apartment. If I just sit there watching television with the curtains drawn, that\u2019s not good for me.", "I might just take a walk or see my friends. But like I said, it seems like they don\u2019t want to be around me so much anymore because I bring them down with me. Do you have some suggestions on what I should do?"];
