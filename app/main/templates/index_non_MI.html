        Welcome to our crowd-powered conversational system! In this system, we will not show the real-time status of other crowd workers you are working with, but you will see the history of conversations that historical workers communicated with the user, which will be displayed in the left window of the screen. The user's utterances are indicated after the <span class="user">User:</span> label, while the responses from the coach who is played by the historical workers are indicated after the <span class="coach">Coach:</span> label. <strong>You are required to continue to play the coach role and provide the user with a consistent response based on the previous conversation history</strong>. Whenever you are ready to respond, type your response to the user's last utterance in the input box.
        <br><br>
        To ease your workload of reading the long conversation history, we introduce a chatbot to help you understand historical context. <strong>You can click on the icon next to the left window to evoke it</strong>, then you will enter the dialog with it. According to the instructions it gives you, you will get a better understanding of the historical content referred to in the user's current utterance, the psychological problems that the user needs to consult, and the clues of historical workers.
