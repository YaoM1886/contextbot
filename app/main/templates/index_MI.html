        Welcome to our crowd-powered conversational system! In this system, we will not show the real-time status of other crowd workers you are working with, but you will see the history of conversations that users had with other workers. This will be displayed in a window on the left of your screen. The user's utterances are indicated after the <span class="user">User:</span> label, while the responses from the coach who is played by the previous workers are indicated after the <span class="coach">Coach:</span> label. <strong>You are required to continue to play the coach role and provide the user with a consistent response based on the history of the ongoing conversation</strong>. Whenever you are ready to respond, type your response to the user's last utterance in the input box.
        <br><br>
        To help you quickly understand the user's concerns, a chatbot, which can be accessed by selecting the button on the right side of the screen, can assist you.
        <br><br>
        Also, because you are playing the role of a coach, having some affective support skills will definitely help. You will be required to adhere to sound affective support techniques. Our chatbot will provide you some advice based on a well-known psychological approach known as motivational interviewing. This involves <strong>talking with empathy and showing a genuine interest in the user's experience and perspective</strong>. Don't worry, our chatbot will assist you with some tips on that.
