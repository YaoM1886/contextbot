["You are feeling upset and confused. One confusing thing, then, is you don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. What\u2019s been happening?", "This blowup wasn\u2019t the first time that\u2019s happened to you.", "Kind of like a pattern that\u2019s repeating itself.", "These are really strong feelings. It\u2019s pretty painful that this has happened once again.", "That frightens you, not understanding what is going on with you.", "And that annoyed you.", "All right. What you\u2019ve told me so far is that these really strong feelings, and how you\u2019ve reacted, are scaring you a little. You\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re having trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. You really blew up at Ray and felt out of control, and you\u2019re also wondering about what seems like a painful pattern that repeats itself in your relationships with men. You don\u2019t have much energy, feel lonely, and sometimes you just break out crying for no apparent reason. But you especially wonder what\u2019s happening.", "Yes, I do. This all feels pretty strange to you, even coming here, but I\u2019ve worked with women before who have had concerns like this, and I believe I can help. If our work together were really successful from your perspective, what would be different?", "So one thing you\u2019d like to change is how you\u2019re feeling. Tell me a little more about that.", "OK, you\u2019d like to get your emotional life settled down some, to be able to sleep better and have more energy. What else?", "That\u2019s another thing that upsets you\u2014not knowing why you feel so bad and why these things happen to you.", "I do have an idea that puts some of the pieces of the puzzle together. If it\u2019s alright with you, we can talk about that next.", "You\u2019re really struggling to understand what is happening to you, and I wonder if I might ask you what you already knew about depression.", "Well, if it\u2019s all right, let me describe some of what people experience with depression, and you can tell me what parts of this may fit for you.", "Depression is really a set of different symptoms, and you don\u2019t need to have all of them. It\u2019s like when people catch a cold; they experience it in different ways. Depression is like that\u2014a set of symptoms that might or might not be present. Does that make sense?", "One of them, as you said, is in a sad mood, feeling down, crying.", "Another change is in sleeping patterns. Some people have trouble sleeping. Some lose their weight. Have you experienced any of those?", "OK. As I said, different people have different symptoms. It sounds like you have quite a few of them. Have I been clear? What else can I tell you about depression?", "The next thing is how you would like things to be different. You know how you don\u2019t want to feel. How do you want to feel?", "You\u2019d like to feel happy and good about yourself again. What else?", " How important is that to you, to have a relationship like that?", "You need that.", "Tell me a little about why you want to feel better.", "It would be good to feel lighthearted, to enjoy life and be with your friends.", "Well I was just going to ask you about that. What are some of your personal strengths? What might your friends say that you have going for you?", "Give me an example. When have you done something or made a change in your life that really took some effort, maybe something you weren\u2019t sure at first that you could do?", " It takes a lot to move to a new place on your own. How did you do it?", " And you did it. That\u2019s a lot of change to manage.", "So use your imagination here. Suppose that we work together and you are successful in making these changes. How might your life be different, say, 5 years from now?", "Well, thanks for all you\u2019ve told me. You\u2019ve been feeling a lot of turmoil in your life and I appreciate how honest and open you have been with me. Let me just pull together what you\u2019ve told me, and then we\u2019ll see what the next step is. You would really like to start feeling better, you\u2019ve been feeling really bad, like you have been dragging a great weight around with you, and you\u2019re rather tired of feeling like your friends avoid you. In the longer run you also want to have an open, warm, and loving relationship with a man. You\u2019re a pretty resourceful person. You moved here from Ireland all on your own and set up a new life for yourself. You\u2019re also a stubborn and persistent person. Once you make up your mind to do something it\u2019s likely to happen. You would like to understand what\u2019s been going wrong in your relationships because somewhere down the line you would like to be married, and you also mentioned finding a better job as a longer-term goal. You\u2019ve been through a lot of emotional pain, and you\u2019re eager for a calmer and happier life. First of all, I would like to know what ideas you have for how you might start feeling better. No one knows you better than you do, and I\u2019m sure you have tried some things in the past to lift your mood a bit. Tell me about those.", "A pleasant movie is one thing that can lift your spirits sometimes. What else?", "You know that about yourself\u2014getting out helps. And what do you do when you leave your apartment?"]
