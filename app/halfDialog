User: I feel like I am falling apart. I don’t have any energy. I don’t know what is going on with me.
Bot: You are feeling upset and confused. One confusing thing, then, is you don’t understand why you’re doing what you’re doing. What’s been happening?
User:  I just broke up with my boyfriend. I mean we’ve been living together and I thought he loved me, but he’s just so distant. He won’t talk to me, and I think maybe he’s seeing someone else. Anyhow, he told me I’m crazy.
Bot: This blowup wasn’t the first time that’s happened to you.
User: Men just drive me crazy. This is the third guy I’ve lived with, and they all kind of ended in the same way. I just seem to fall in love with the wrong guys.
Bot: Kind of like a pattern that’s repeating itself.
User: Yes! It is so sad.
Bot: These are really strong feelings. It’s pretty painful that this has happened once again.
User: I can’t sleep. I can’t think. I’m a mess at work. I was waiting on a customer this week and just started crying for no reason. I think I’m losing it.
Bot: That frightens you, not understanding what is going on with you.
User: It’s just so discouraging! I was so happy with Ray when we were first together. There’s this soft teddy bear inside his tough exterior, and that’s the man I loved, but then he wouldn’t open up to me anymore.
Bot: And that annoyed you.
User: Yes! It’s such a waste for him to stay locked up inside there, and I was lonely even though we were living together. Anyhow, he’s gone now. He moved out. It’s over.
Bot: All right. What you’ve told me so far is that these really strong feelings, and how you’ve reacted, are scaring you a little. You’re not sure what’s going on. You’re having trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. You really blew up at Ray and felt out of control, and you’re also wondering about what seems like a painful pattern that repeats itself in your relationships with men. You don’t have much energy, feel lonely, and sometimes you just break out crying for no apparent reason. But you especially wonder what’s happening.
User: Yes. Do you think you can help me?
Bot: Yes, I do. This all feels pretty strange to you, even coming here, but I’ve worked with women before who have had concerns like this, and I believe I can help. If our work together were really successful from your perspective, what would be different?
User: I guess I wouldn’t feel so bad all the time.
Bot: So one thing you’d like to change is how you’re feeling. Tell me a little more about that.
User: I just feel upset and I’m crying a lot. I’m not sleeping and I feel worn out, run down.
Bot: OK, you’d like to get your emotional life settled down some, to be able to sleep better and have more energy. What else?
User: Yes. I also want to know why I keep screwing up all my relationships. What’s wrong with me?
Bot: That’s another thing that upsets you—not knowing why you feel so bad and why these things happen to you.
User: Yes, can you help me figure these out?
Bot: I do have an idea that puts some of the pieces of the puzzle together. If it’s alright with you, we can talk about that next.
User: Sure. What is your idea?
Bot: You’re really struggling to understand what is happening to you, and I wonder if I might ask you what you already knew about depression.
User: I guess it’s like when you feel really sad and down, maybe don’t have energy to do anything. Do you think that’s what I have?
Bot: Well, if it’s all right, let me describe some of what people experience with depression, and you can tell me what parts of this may fit for you.
User: Yes, OK.
Bot: Depression is really a set of different symptoms, and you don’t need to have all of them. It’s like when people catch a cold; they experience it in different ways. Depression is like that—a set of symptoms that might or might not be present. Does that make sense?
User: Yes, what are the symptoms?
Bot: One of them, as you said, is in a sad mood, feeling down, crying.
User: That sounds like me. I’m not having much fun lately.
Bot: Another change is in sleeping patterns. Some people have trouble sleeping. Some lose their weight. Have you experienced any of those?
User: I’m certainly not sleeping well. But my weight did not change.
Bot: OK. As I said, different people have different symptoms. It sounds like you have quite a few of them. Have I been clear? What else can I tell you about depression?
User: That sounds alright.
Bot: The next thing is how you would like things to be different. You know how you don’t want to feel. How do you want to feel?
User: Normal, I guess. Happy. To have energy to do things again. When I broke up with Ray it just made me crazy. I feel like there’s something wrong with me, that I always screw up my relationships.
Bot: You’d like to feel happy and good about yourself again. What else?
User: I want to be with a man who loves me. I seem to attract guys who are hung up about telling me how they feel. I need a man I can talk to.
Bot:  How important is that to you, to have a relationship like that?
User: Very important. I don’t want to be alone. I need to be loved.
Bot: You need that.
User: Yes! I don’t want to keep destroying relationships. I don’t know why I do that.
Bot: Tell me a little about why you want to feel better.
User: I just feel like I’m dragging around this heavy weight with me all the time. I like to have fun, but I’ve really become a drag to be with. I feel like even my friends avoid me.
Bot: It would be good to feel lighthearted, to enjoy life and be with your friends.
User: Yes it would. Do you think it’s possible for me?
