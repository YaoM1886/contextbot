["I feel like I am falling apart. I don\u2019t have any energy. I don\u2019t know what is going on with me.", " I just broke up with my boyfriend. I mean we\u2019ve been living together and I thought he loved me, but he\u2019s just so distant. He won\u2019t talk to me, and I think maybe he\u2019s seeing someone else. Anyhow, he told me I\u2019m crazy.", "Men just drive me crazy. This is the third guy I\u2019ve lived with, and they all kind of ended in the same way. I just seem to fall in love with the wrong guys.", "Yes! It is so sad.", "I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t think. I\u2019m a mess at work. I was waiting on a customer this week and just started crying for no reason. I think I\u2019m losing it.", "It\u2019s just so discouraging! I was so happy with Ray when we were first together. There\u2019s this soft teddy bear inside his tough exterior, and that\u2019s the man I loved, but then he wouldn\u2019t open up to me anymore.", "Yes! It\u2019s such a waste for him to stay locked up inside there, and I was lonely even though we were living together. Anyhow, he\u2019s gone now. He moved out. It\u2019s over.", "Yes. Do you think you can help me?", "I guess I wouldn\u2019t feel so bad all the time.", "I just feel upset and I\u2019m crying a lot. I\u2019m not sleeping and I feel worn out, run down.", "Yes. I also want to know why I keep screwing up all my relationships. What\u2019s wrong with me?", "Yes, can you help me figure these out?", "Sure. What is your idea?", "I guess it\u2019s like when you feel really sad and down, maybe don\u2019t have energy to do anything. Do you think that\u2019s what I have?", "Yes, OK.", "Yes, what are the symptoms?", "That sounds like me. I\u2019m not having much fun lately.", "I\u2019m certainly not sleeping well. But my weight did not change.", "That sounds alright.", "Normal, I guess. Happy. To have energy to do things again. When I broke up with Ray it just made me crazy. I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me, that I always screw up my relationships.", "I want to be with a man who loves me. I seem to attract guys who are hung up about telling me how they feel. I need a man I can talk to.", "Very important. I don\u2019t want to be alone. I need to be loved.", "Yes! I don\u2019t want to keep destroying relationships. I don\u2019t know why I do that.", "I just feel like I\u2019m dragging around this heavy weight with me all the time. I like to have fun, but I\u2019ve really become a drag to be with. I feel like even my friends avoid me.", "Yes it would. Do you think it\u2019s possible for me?", "I don\u2019t know. They\u2019d probably say that I\u2019m stubborn. I\u2019ve been pretty persistent in the past.", "Moving here. I had always lived in Ireland near my father and my sisters, and I moved out here all by myself. I just wanted to be on my own for a change, to get away. But now I feel too much on my own.", "I had to find a job here, and I started going to classes at the university. I had to get used to a different culture, figure out the stores and banking system, and make some friends.", "I never thought much about it. I guess I can do it when it\u2019s important enough.", "I\u2019d be married, maybe have a family. I\u2019d have a better job that I enjoy more. I just wouldn\u2019t be stressing out like this all the time. A calmer life.", "Sometimes I have gone to a funny, romantic movie and it makes me smile, but it also reminds me of what I don\u2019t have in a relationship.", "Getting out of my apartment. If I just sit there watching television with the curtains drawn, that\u2019s not good for me.", "I might just take a walk or see my friends. But like I said, it seems like they don\u2019t want to be around me so much anymore because I bring them down with me. Do you have some suggestions on what I should do?"]
